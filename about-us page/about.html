        <p>
        In 2021, my interest in the stock market was sparked by the web series <em> <b>"Scam 1992</b></em>," which fueled my curiosity about finance and trading. I began closely following the stock market and sought to deepen my understanding of it. I learned how to conduct <em><b>fundamental, technical, and economic analysis</b></em>, and then delved into various financial assets, including<em><b> cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and NFTs</b></em>, through practical experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite my academic background in computer applications (BCA), my passion has always been rooted in finance. This dual interest in finance and technology has driven me to combine my skills in both fields. As part of my ongoing learning process, I am currently building this website from scratch, utilizing my coding skills to create a platform that reflects my understanding of finance and stock market analysis. This project allows me to merge my interests in computer science and engineering with my dedication to financial analysis, providing a comprehensive learning experience that keeps me engaged and motivated.
