      <div class="ratio">
          <h2>1.On the basis of Asset Quality (GNPA and NNPA)- Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA): </h2>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The total amount of loans that are not being repaid by borrowers.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Indicates the overall health of the bank’s loan portfolio. A lower GNPA ratio suggests better credit management.</p>
          <p><strong>Industry Benchmark:</strong> For private banks in India, the average GNPA ratio was 4.5% as of March 31, 2023.</p>
          <p><strong>IDFC FIRST Bank Status:</strong> Has a GNPA ratio around 2%, indicating good asset quality.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="ratio">
          <h2> Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA):</h2>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The amount of GNPA after deducting provisions made by the bank.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Reflects the actual risk posed by bad loans after accounting for potential losses.</p>
          <p><strong>Industry Benchmark:</strong> The average NNPA ratio for private banks was 2.5%.</p>
          <p><strong>IDFC FIRST Bank Status:</strong> Around 1%, showing effective management of bad loans.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="ratio">
          <h2>2. On the basis of potential losses from NPA- Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR)</h2>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Provisions made against NPAs to cover expected losses from NPAs.</p>
          <p><strong>Formula:</strong>Provisions = GNPA - NNPA and PCR = Total Provisions / Total NPAs.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> A higher PCR indicates a strong buffer against bad loans. RBI mandates a minimum PCR of 70%.</p>
          <p><strong>IDFC FIRST Bank Status:</strong> Increasing PCR is a positive sign, showing the bank is prepared for potential defaults and can cover losses without significantly impacting profits</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="ratio">
          <h2>3.On the basis of Deposits- CASA Ratio:</h2>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ratio of current and savings account deposits to total deposits.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Indicates the stability of the bank’s deposit base. Higher CASA ratios mean more stable and lower-cost funding.</p>
          <p><strong>Industry Benchmark:</strong> The average CASA ratio for the industry is around 38%.</p>
          <p><strong>IDFC FIRST Bank Status:</strong> 49.77%, indicating a strong and stable deposit base.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="ratio">
          <h2>4. On the basis of Profitability-Net Interest Margin (NIM):</h2>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The difference between the interest income generated and the interest paid out relative to the bank's interest-earning assets.</p>
          <p><strong>Formula:</strong> NIM = (Interest Income - Interest Expense) / Average Earning Assets.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Measures the efficiency of the bank’s investment decisions and its ability to manage its interest spread.</p>
          <p><strong>IDFC FIRST Bank Status:</strong> Not directly mentioned in the document, but it's a critical ratio for profitability analysis.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="ratio">
          <h2>5. On the basis of Liquidity of Banks- Capital Adequacy Ratio(CAR):</h2>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A measure of a bank's capital, expressed as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p><strong>Formula:</strong> CAR = (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) / Risk-Weighted Assets.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Ensures the bank has enough capital to absorb potential losses and protect depositors.</p>
          <p><strong>Regulatory Requirement:</strong> RBI mandates a minimum CAR of 9%.</p>
          <p><strong>IDFC FIRST Bank Status:</strong> Not specified in the document, but crucial for assessing financial stability.</p>
