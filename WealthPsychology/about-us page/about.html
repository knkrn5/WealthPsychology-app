            I started to develop an interest in the stock market in 2021 after watching the web series <em>"Scam 1992,"</em> which piqued my curiosity about the world of finance and trading. I began to follow the stock market more closely and wanted to gain a deeper understanding of its mechanisms. During my search for reliable educational resources, I came across CA Rachna Ranade's YouTube channel. Her detailed and practical approach to teaching stock market fundamentals and technical analysis intrigued me, so anyhow i her courses and started learning.

            Through her courses, I gained substantial knowledge about the stock market, which laid a solid foundation for my investing and trading journey. As I delved deeper into the world of finance and trading, I continuously sought out various sources to enhance my understanding and skills. Over time, I accumulated more than four years of experience in trading both equity and derivatives. I trade based on my  strategies and  risk-reward management, which I apply to my trades on a daily basis.

            In addition to trading equities, my curiosity led me to explore other financial assets such as futures-options derivatives, and cryptocurrencies. I dedicated time to learning how to analyze and invest in these assets, gradually incorporating them into my trading portfolio. This journey of continuous learning and adaptation has been both challenging and rewarding.

            Despite my academic background in computer applications (BCA), my passion has always been rooted in finance. This dual interest in finance and technology has driven me to combine my skills in both fields. As part of my ongoing learning process, I am currently building a website from scratch, utilizing my coding skills to create a platform that reflects my understanding of finance and stock market analysis. This project allows me to merge my interests in computer science and engineering with my dedication to financial analysis, providing a comprehensive learning experience that keeps me engaged and motivated.
